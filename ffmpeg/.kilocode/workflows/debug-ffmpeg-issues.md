# Debug FFmpeg Processing Issues

## Systematic Debugging Steps
1. **Identify the Problem**:
   - Check console logs for FFmpeg error messages
   - Verify input file format and size
   - Test with different file types to isolate issue

2. **FFmpeg Command Validation**:
   - Log the exact FFmpeg command being executed
   - Test command manually in terminal
   - Check for missing codecs or dependencies

3. **File System Debugging**:
   - Verify file paths and permissions
   - Check available disk space
   - Ensure temporary directories exist and are writable

4. **Network and API Debugging**:
   - Test API endpoints with curl or Postman
   - Check for timeout issues on large files
   - Verify CORS and file upload limits

5. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Monitor memory usage during processing
   - Check CPU usage and processing times
   - Identify bottlenecks in file I/O operations

## Common Solutions
- Update FFmpeg binary or fluent-ffmpeg library
- Adjust file size limits and timeout settings
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Add file format validation before processing
