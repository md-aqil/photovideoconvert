## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Single Server Deployment
- **Best for**: Small to medium traffic applications
- **Setup**: Both frontend and backend on one server
- **Pros**: Simpler setup, lower cost
- **Cons**: Less scalable, single point of failure

### Option 2: Multi-Server Deployment
- **Best for**: High traffic applications
- **Setup**: Separate servers for frontend, backend, and database
- **Pros**: Better scalability, improved performance
- **Cons**: More complex setup, higher cost

### Option 3: Containerized Deployment (Docker)
- **Best for**: Development consistency, easy scaling
- **Setup**: Docker containers for frontend, backend, and services
- **Pros**: Consistent environments, easy scaling
- **Cons**: Learning curve, container management overhead

### Option 4: Cloud Platform Deployment
- **Best for**: Rapid deployment, managed services
- **Options**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku, Vercel
- **Pros**: Managed infrastructure, built-in scaling
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, potential cost increases

## Production Considerations

2. Run backend tests
3. Deploy backend to staging
4. Deploy frontend to staging
5. Test staging environment
6. Deploy backend to production
7. Deploy frontend to production
8. Verify production deployment
9. Monitor for issues

### 3. Rollback Procedure
